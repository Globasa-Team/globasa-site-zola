## Globasa's Stability
**How stable is Globasa at this point? Is it safe to start learning it without the prospect of having to relearn words and grammar through endless reforms?**

Yes, it is safe to start learning Globasa with the certainty that there will be no endless reforms. Click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Globasa/comments/qskclh/globasas_stability_comparison_of_original_globasa/) to see a text comparing Globasa as it was originally published with current Globasa. [Phase 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/Globasa/comments/rt0tdl/fase_5/) was announced on January, 2022. At this stage, we have established a language development committee and have begun the process of translating the website, meaning that Globasa will move forward with even greater stability. Grammar and word-form adjustments that are deemed absolutely necessary will be voted on and made by said committee. Other than that, we may also see some semantic adjustments. Click [here](https://www.globasa.net/eng/pimpan-swal/alogi-ji-lilalogi) to see the list of changes and adjustments that have been made in each Phase. As you can see, there have been fewer and fewer changes and adjustments as we move forward. I would add that Globasa started off around 90% stable and is now about 99% stable.
