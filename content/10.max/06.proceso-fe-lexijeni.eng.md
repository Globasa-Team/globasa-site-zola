## Word Proposal Process
 
Any Globasa speaker may propose new root words using either the [Globasa subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Globasa/) or the [Globasa Wikia](https://globasa.fandom.com/wiki/Proposed_words). Any word proposal originating in the Wikia must be moved to subreddit for discussion.

The word proposal and selection process is as follows:

1\. Propose new root word definition

2\. Discuss the possibility of using a derived word or an existing Globasa word to express the proposed word definition

3\. If it is determined that a new root word should be selected: use the [word selection methodology](/max/metode-fe-lexiseleti) to propose a source and suggest a form for the new root word

4\. Discuss form of new root word, which includes consulting with [admin tools](http://menalari.globasa.net/eng/tul) for homonym and minimal pair conflicts.

5\. Add new root word to the dictionary and use the established etymology format
